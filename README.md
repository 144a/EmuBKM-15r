# EmuBKM-15r
A simple script to emulate the Sony BKM-15r Controller for A series BVM CRT Monitors

It is written in python for ease of use on other machines, and can be run on almost any machine.

At the moment, knobs have not been implemented, but will be in the future.

Before Running the script, make sure you have a static ip address of 192.168.0.100
